      <p>I am in my 8th semester of undergraduate studies in systems engineering and computer science at the Universidad de los Andes, Colombia.
        I live with my mom, my brother and my two dogs.
      I am interested in mobile development, IoT and in the last few months I have discovered a great curiosity in Machine Learning and related topics.</p>
